        <h2>Description</h2>
            <P> Fried rice is a takeout favorite, but it's also quick and easy to make at home. It's a great way to use up leftover rice (cooked, cold rice makes the best fried rice) and transform boring leftovers into an entirely new dish. The next time you're making rice, just make extra and stash it away. Then, you'll have a delicious, quick fried rice dinner in no time.</P>
            <p>This is a basic recipe for fried rice that you can add to as desired. Medium- or long-grained white rice works best, but other types of rice can be used as well. Serve it as a side with leftover vegetables mixed in or as a main dish with barbecued pork, chicken, or shrimp. Once you have this basic recipe mastered, you can feel free to adjust it to suit your needs and taste.</p>
