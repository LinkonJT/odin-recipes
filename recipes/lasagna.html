            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is one recipe my wife begs me to make. He is obsessed with this lasagna and if he is stressed or overwhelmed with work, this is what I make him. It is the perfect comfort food meal! There's something so amazing about homemade, made-from-scratch lasagna.  Whenever he orders beef lasagna at a restaurant, he ends up disappointed. This is such a warm, comforting dinner and can feed a crowd (or at least a lot of hungry kids).</p>
            <p>This is a classic homemade lasagna recipe made with layers of gooey melted mozzarella cheese, a parmesan ricotta cheese, and a robust tomato meat sauce. It is perfect for weeknight dinners, potlucks, or to take to friends who just had a baby.  This lasagna recipe can be frozen so it is perfect to made ahead of time. It also makes flavorful leftovers.</p>
